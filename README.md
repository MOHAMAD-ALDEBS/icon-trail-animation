# 📚 Full-Stack Practice Projects

A collection of small frontend and backend practice projects built to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

This repository is mainly for learning, experimenting, and building a portfolio of simple but useful applications.

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

* Strengthen my HTML & CSS fundamentals
* Improve in JavaScript (DOM, events, ES6+)
* Build practical frontend components
* Understand backend basics with Node.js + Express
* Learn how to work with databases using MongoDB + Mongoose
* Practice creating REST APIs and CRUD operations
* Build small, complete full-stack applications
